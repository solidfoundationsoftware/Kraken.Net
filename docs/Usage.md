## Creating client
There are 2 clients available to interact with the Kraken API, the `KrakenRestClient` and `KrakenSocketClient`. They can be created manually on the fly or be added to the dotnet DI using the `AddHuobi` extension method.

*Create a new rest client*
```csharp
var krakenRestClient = new KrakenRestClient(options => 
{
    // Set options here for this client
});

var krakenSocketClient = new KrakenSocketClient(options =>
{
    // Set options here for this client
});
```

**Warning:** This creates a new HttpClient for each instance and could lead to sockets exhaustion under high load. Favor the usage of the HttpClientFactory achieved via registration in the DI container described below or use the overloaded constructor to inject your own HttpClient.

*Using dotnet dependency inject*
```csharp
services.AddKraken(
    restOptions => {
        // set options for the rest client
    },
    socketClientOptions => {
        // set options for the socket client
    }); 
    
// IKrakenRestClient, IKrakenSocketClient and IKrakenOrderBookFactory are now available for injecting
```

Different options are available to set on the clients, see this example
```csharp
var krakenRestClient = new KrakenRestClient(options =>
{
    options.ApiCredentials = new ApiCredentials("API-KEY", "API-SECRET");
    options.RequestTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60);
});
```
Alternatively, options can be provided before creating clients by using `SetDefaultOptions` or during the registration in the DI container:  
```csharp
KrakenRestClient.SetDefaultOptions(options => {
    // Set options here for all new clients
});
var krakenRestClient = new KrakenRestClient();
```
More info on the specific options can be found in the [CryptoExchange.Net documentation](https://jkorf.github.io/CryptoExchange.Net/Options.html)
